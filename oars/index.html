<h1>OAR Files Converted to GLTF with Convoar</h1>
<p>
Collection of 
<a href="http://opensimulator.org">OpenSimulator</a>
archive files ("OAR files")
converted to
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/gltf/">GLTF</a>
using
<a href="https://github.com/Misterblue/convoar">Convoar</a>
.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/Misterblue/convoar">Convoar</a>
reads the OAR file, converts the prims into meshes, and outputs
the region as a
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/gltf/">GLTF</a>
scene.
There are some optimization that are done so there are several
versions of each converted OAR file below:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>unoptimized</b>:
            a straight conversion of the region.
            All textures are original size and terrain is maximum resolution.
            This is the best version for loading into
            <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>
            or equivilant mesh scene editor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>smallassets</b>:
            meshes are unchanged from the unoptimized version but all
            textures have been resized to be 256 pixels or less in any dimension
            and the terrain is half resolution.
            These two optimizations make significant improvements in the
            scene load time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>mergedmaterials</b>:
            the meshes scene has been completely reorganized based on their material
            rather than their object.
            This makes the
            <a href="https://www.khronos.org/gltf/">GLTF</a>
            scene completely uneditable but greatly reduces the draw count
            and makes even very complex regions displayable with WebGL.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
Each of the converted versions of the original OAR can be downloaded (the
<b>TGZ</b> and <b>ZIP</b> buttons while the <b>OAR</b> button downloads the
original OAR file).
</p>
<p>
The <b>VIEW</b> button opens another browser page with a simple
<a href="https://threejs.org">ThreeJS</a> viewer on that version of the 
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/gltf/">GLTF</a>
file.
Be sure to close that view page as having several views open at the same time
till greatly overtax any graphics card.
